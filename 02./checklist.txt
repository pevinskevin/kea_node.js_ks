- Understand scoping in Javascript,  and know to always use const if you can get away with it otherwise let. ✅

    There are three kinds of scope in Javascript.
    1. Global scope
    2. Function scope
    3. block scope.

    Global scope means that a variable has been declared outside of any functions and code blocks.
    It is thus globally accessible in the script. This applies to both var, let and const.

    Function scope means that a variable is accessible within a function.
    Only var falls under "function scope" meaning that eg:
    You declare it within a if-else block nested in a function, the var
    variable will still be available outside of the if-else block since it has function scope.
    It won't be accessible outside of the function however. 

    Block scope means that it's only available within the code block that it has been declared in.
    This only applies to let and const. A let and const variabl declared in a function, will be available to any subsequent loops, functions etc. and their variables nested in the parent function.
    The variables will not be available outside of the block scope.
